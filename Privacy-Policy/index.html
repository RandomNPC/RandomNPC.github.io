    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, which will prevent them from accessing parts of the website.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h2>
      <p>With your authorization, randomnpc.github.io obtains information about you from other sources.

The information received depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>
    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>randomnpc.github.io discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information to process it on randomnpc.github.io’s behalf or to provide services available at randomnpc.github.io’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, randomnpc.github.io discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when randomnpc.github.io believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of randomnpc.github.io, third parties or the public at large.
